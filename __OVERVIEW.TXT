Hey - Have another one for you...going to send you 2 attachments...

Basically, need you to update the GD MGMT servers (I think there are 2 of them) with the settings that are contained in the attachments.
...basically just getting our MGMT servers up to their CIS standards....I guess charge this to a ticket for now, but may have different 
guidance early next week...just give me a shout if you have any questions...thanks!
